<!-- The bind(this) method is crucial here. It ensures that when handleClick is called in response to the button click, 
 the this keyword inside handleClick refers to the current instance of the React class.
Without bind(this), this inside handleClick would refer to the button element itself when the event occurs, which is typically not desired. -->
